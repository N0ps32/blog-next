            <description><![CDATA[HTTP/2 offers many advantages over legacy protocols like HTTP/1.1. One of those features is Server Push, a way to push assets to the client before the server supplies the requested HTML document. This allows for faster load-times for critical assets. In this example I will be using the Caddy webserver, however modern Apache 2 and nginx versions also support Sever Push and HTTP/2.

            <description><![CDATA[This is my review of the Tolino Shine 3. While the device has some strong points it disappoints in others. It's a relatively cheap E-Reader featuring an E-Ink display. E-Ink is a cool technology that uses electrically charged pigments to draw an image on the screen that persists without any power applied to it. Meaning you should get days or even weeks of battery life out of a device like this.
